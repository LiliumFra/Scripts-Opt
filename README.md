## 🌟 Overview

**Windows Neural Optimizer v6.0 ULTRA** is a massive leap forward in system optimization. Beyond standard tweaks, it introduces an **AI-driven Recommendation Engine**, **Machine Learning Usage Analysis**, and a **Safety-First Registry System**. It now natively supports **English and Spanish** (auto-detected), making high-performance computing accessible to more users.

## ✨ New in v6.0

### 🛡️ Safety & Reliability

- **Smart Registry Backups**: Every registry change is automatically backed up to a `.reg` file in `Backups/` before application.
- **Rollback System**: Integrated menu option to undo changes safely.
- **System Restore**: Auto-creates restore points before major operations.

### 🌍 Neural Localization

- **Bilingual Interface**: Automatically detects your OS language (ES/EN) and adapts the UI, logs, and messages instantly.
- **Manual Override**: Change language anytime via config or console.

### 🔥 Ultra Performance Modules

- **Advanced Gaming**: MSI Mode configuration, High Precision Event Timer (HPET) tuning, and competitive network settings.
- **Memory Intelligence**: Dynamic pagefile management and pool optimization based on usage patterns.
- **SSD/NVMe Guard**: TRIM optimization and power state management tailored to drive health.

### 🧠 AI & Machine Learning

- **AI Recommendations**: Scans your hardware and suggests specific optimizations (e.g., "Disable HAGS for this GPU", "Enable LargeSystemCache for 32GB RAM").
- **ML Usage Patterns**: Analyzes your typical usage (Gaming vs Work) to auto-tune background services.

## 📦 Modular Architecture

| Category | Modules | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core** | `Optimize-Windows.ps1` | **Main Controller**. Launch this to start. |
| **Foundation** | `NeuralUtils.psm1`, `NeuralLocalization.psm1` | Shared libraries for safety, logging, and translation. |
| **Standard** | `Boot`, `Debloat`, `Disk`, `Gaming`, `Thermal` | Essential tweaks for every system. |
| **Ultra** | `Advanced-Gaming`, `Advanced-Memory`, `SSD-NVMe` | Deep-dive optimizations for enthusiasts. |
| **Experimental** | `Advanced-Registry`, `Update-System` | Cutting-edge tweaks and git-based auto-updates. |
| **AI/ML** | `AI-Recommendations`, `ML-Usage-Patterns` | Smart logic to tailor the experience to YOU. |
| **Tools** | `System-Monitor`, `Benchmark`, `Health-Check` | Real-time diagnostics and verification. |

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1️⃣ Installation

1. **Download** the latest version (Clone or Zip).
2. Right-click `Run-Optimizer.bat` and select **Run as Administrator**.
   - *It will automatically request privileges and bypass execution policy safely.*

### 2️⃣ Main Menu Navigation

The new Neural Interface is divided into 4 intuitive categories:

#### **[1] 🚀 QUICK OPTIMIZE**

- **Best for beginners.**
- Runs a curated sequence of safe, high-impact modules:
  - `Boot-Optimization`: Faster startup.
  - `Debloat-Suite`: Removes bloatware.
  - `Disk-Hygiene`: Cleans junk files.
  - `Gaming-Optimization`: Standard gaming tweaks.

#### **[2] 🧠 AI SMART OPTIMIZE**

- **Interactive Intelligence.**
- Scans your specific hardware (CPU, GPU, RAM, Storage).
- **NEW**: Generates a list of tailored recommendations.
- **NEW**: Interactive prompt asks if you want to **Auto-Apply** high-priority fixes immediately.

#### **[3] 🛠️ ADVANCED TOOLS**

- **For power users.** Opens a sub-menu with granular control:
  - `Ultra Gaming`: MSI Mode, HPET, specific latency tweaks.
  - `Advanced Memory`: Pagefile tuning, large page support.
  - `SSD/NVMe`: Drive-specific optimizations.
  - `Network`: TCP/IP stack tuning (BBR, CTCP).
  - `System Monitor`: Real-time resource tracking.

#### **[4] 🛡️ SAFETY & RESTORE**

- **Safety first.**
- **Create Restore Point**: Manually capture system state.
- **View Backups**: Open the dedicated registry backup folder.
- **Rollback**: Instructions on how to undo changes via System Restore.

### 3️⃣ Health Check

- Run **Health-Check** (Option 12 in Advanced) to verify your system integrity (SFC/DISM) after heavy optimization.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This tool interacts deeply with Windows internals (Registry, Services, Boot Manager).  
**v6.0 includes robust backup systems**, but **ALWAYS** proceed with caution.
