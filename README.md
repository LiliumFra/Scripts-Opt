## 🌟 Overview

**Windows Neural Optimizer v6.0 ULTRA** is a massive leap forward in system optimization. Beyond standard tweaks, it introduces an **AI-driven Recommendation Engine**, **Machine Learning Usage Analysis**, and a **Safety-First Registry System**. It now natively supports **English and Spanish** (auto-detected), making high-performance computing accessible to more users.

## ✨ New in v6.0

### 🛡️ Safety & Reliability

- **Smart Registry Backups**: Every registry change is automatically backed up to a `.reg` file in `Backups/` before application.
- **Rollback System**: Integrated menu option to undo changes safely.
- **System Restore**: Auto-creates restore points before major operations.

### 🌍 Neural Localization

- **Bilingual Interface**: Automatically detects your OS language (ES/EN) and adapts the UI, logs, and messages instantly.
- **Manual Override**: Change language anytime via config or console.

### 🔥 Ultra Performance Modules

- **Advanced Gaming**: MSI Mode configuration, High Precision Event Timer (HPET) tuning, and competitive network settings.
- **Memory Intelligence**: Dynamic pagefile management and pool optimization based on usage patterns.
- **SSD/NVMe Guard**: TRIM optimization and power state management tailored to drive health.

### 🧠 AI & Machine Learning

- **AI Recommendations**: Scans your hardware and suggests specific optimizations (e.g., "Disable HAGS for this GPU", "Enable LargeSystemCache for 32GB RAM").
- **ML Usage Patterns**: Analyzes your typical usage (Gaming vs Work) to auto-tune background services.

## 📦 Modular Architecture

| Category | Modules | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core** | `Optimize-Windows.ps1` | **Main Controller**. Launch this to start. |
| **Foundation** | `NeuralUtils.psm1`, `NeuralLocalization.psm1` | Shared libraries for safety, logging, and translation. |
| **Standard** | `Boot`, `Debloat`, `Disk`, `Gaming`, `Thermal` | Essential tweaks for every system. |
| **Ultra** | `Advanced-Gaming`, `Advanced-Memory`, `SSD-NVMe` | Deep-dive optimizations for enthusiasts. |
| **Experimental** | `Advanced-Registry`, `Update-System` | Cutting-edge tweaks and git-based auto-updates. |
| **AI/ML** | `AI-Recommendations`, `ML-Usage-Patterns` | Smart logic to tailor the experience to YOU. |
| **Tools** | `System-Monitor`, `Benchmark`, `Health-Check` | Real-time diagnostics and verification. |

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Download** the repository (Clone or Zip).
2. Double-click **`Run-Optimizer.bat`**.
   - *Automatically requests Admin privileges and launches the Neural Interface.*
3. **Select an Option**:
   - `[1-5]`: Standard individual optimizations.
   - `[6]`: **Run ALL Standard Modules**.
   - `[7-9]`: Ultra performance modules (Use with care!).
   - `[11-13]`: AI and ML analysis.
   - `[20]`: **Health Check** to verify system integrity.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This tool interacts deeply with Windows internals (Registry, Services, Boot Manager).  
**v6.0 includes robust backup systems**, but **ALWAYS** proceed with caution.
